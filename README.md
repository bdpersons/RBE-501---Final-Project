# Simulation Documentation

#### Description
The simulation demonstrates a 3D model of our robotic manipulator by utilizing a URDF. This URDF was created in SolidWorks and implemented by following tutorials found throughout the internet such as the ROS tutorial found at the following link: http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials. This simulation allows the team to demonstrate what the experimental robot was doing while it was completing the light painting on a higher level view. Below are the instructions on how to run the simulation within our repository.

#### Instructions
1. Clone the repository. If you need assistance cloning the repository follow the steps found at this link: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository.
1. Once the repository is clone, open up MATLAB and change your folder directory to the cloned repository.
1. Open the file labeled "main-sim.m"
1. Click "run" under the editor tab.
1. The simulation with the URDF should show up in a 3D MATLAB graph.

*Note: The URDF has to be plotted everytime, therefore the graph is very jumpy/slow. However, it still traces the trajectory and works very well in the experimentation verison of the code.*
